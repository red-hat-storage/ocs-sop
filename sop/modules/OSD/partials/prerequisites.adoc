=== Verify cluster access
Check the output to ensure you are in the correct context for the cluster mentioned in the alert. If not, please change context and proceed.

.List clusters you have permission to access:
[source,role="execute"]
----
ocm list clusters
----
From the list above, find the cluster id of the cluster named in the alert. If you do not see the alerting cluster in the list above please contact: WIP

.Grab your credentials and place in kubeconfig:
[source,role="execute"]
----
ocm get /api/clusters_mgmt/v1/clusters/<cluster id>/credentials \
  | jq -r .kubeconfig
----

=== Check Alerts

.Set port-forwarding for alertmanager:
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc port-forward alertmanager-managed-ocs-alertmanager-0 9093 -n openshift-storage
----

.Check all alerts
[source,role="execute"]
----
curl http://localhost:9093/api/v1/alerts | jq '.data[] | select( .labels.alertname) | { ALERT: .labels.alertname, STATE: .status.state}'
----



=== Check OCS Ceph Cluster Health
You may directly check OCS Ceph Cluster health by using the rook-ceph toolbox.
.Step 1: Check and document ceph cluster health:
[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

.Step 2: From the rsh command prompt, run the following and capture the output.
[source,shell]
----
ceph status
ceph osd status
exit
----

If 'ceph status' is not in *HEALTH_OK*, please look at the Troubleshooting section to resolve issue.
