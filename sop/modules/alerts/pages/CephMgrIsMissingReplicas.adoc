== Check Description 

*Severity:* Warning

*Potential Customer Impact:* High


== Overview
Ceph Manager is missing replicas. This impacts health status reporting and will cause some of the information reported by `ceph status` to be missing or stale. In addition, the ceph manager is responsible for a Manager framework aimed at expanding the Ceph existing capabilities.

To resolve this alert, you will need to determine the cause of the disappearance of the Ceph Manager and restart if necessary.
