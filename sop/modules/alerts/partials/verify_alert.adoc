.Verify the alert is still active:
----


Get the route to this cluster's alertmanager:
MYALERTMANAGER=$(oc -n openshift-monitoring get routes/alertmanager-main --no-headers | awk '{print $2}')

Get your alertname from the alert, set for use in jq:
export MYALERTNAME="<alertname from alert>"

To see if this single alert is active run: 
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc -n openshift-monitoring sa get-token prometheus-k8s)"  https://${MYALERTMANAGER}/api/v1/alerts | jq '.data[] | select( .labels.alertname | test(env.MYALERTNAME)) | { ALERT: .labels.alertname, STATE: .status.state}'

No entries means the alert is no longer active. Some alerts, such as mismatch versions, can occur during upgrades and resolve themselves. If this alert is not a mismatch version alert then there should be an investigation into what triggered the alert even though the alert resolved. Look for other active alerts or alerts with similiar timing. 

If you need more details run:
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc -n openshift-monitoring sa get-token prometheus-k8s)"  https://${MYALERTMANAGER}/api/v1/alerts | jq '.data[] | select( .labels.alertname | test(env.MYALERTNAME)) | { ALERTDETAILS: .}'
